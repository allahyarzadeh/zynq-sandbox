This is a collection of tools, scripts, verilog, etc, for experimenting
with the Xilinx Zynq SoC FPGA, particularly around using a commandline
workflow and avoiding the IPI (IP Integrator) workflow.

An earlier version that attempted to make use of IPI from the commandline
lives in the deprecated-v0 branch.

Warning:  This is very much a work in progress.

Projects
--------
zybo-hdmi            - display a test pattern ZYBO board's HDMI output
zybo-hdmi-axi        - same, but add an axi slave to adjust the pattern

Repository Layout
-----------------
hdl/...              - verilog, systemverilog, and xdc sources
build/...            - makefiles and tcl scripts

Generated Files
---------------
ip/${name}/...       - where Vivado IP packages are generated
sim/${name}-vsim/... - where Verilator intermediates are generated
synth/${name}/...    - where Vivado synthesis intermediates are generated
out/...              - where FPGA final products (bitfiles/etc) end up
out/${name}.bit      - bitfile for project name

Build System Notes
------------------

1. Declare the name of the module and its sources (.v, .sv, .hex):

MODULE_NAME := ...  
MODULE_SRCS := ...

2. invoke the appropriate build rules for the module type:

include build/verilator-sim.mk 
  - create Verilator simulation target
  - required: a top level module named testbench(input clk)
  - provided: clock signal
  - to run:  make modulename-vsim

include build/vivado-bitfile.mk
  - create Xilinx out/$(MODULE_NAME).bit bitfile 
  - target device MODULE_PART
  - required: a top level module named top
  - to build:  make modulename

Tools
-----
build/mkzynq.go      - Generates useful wrappers around Zynq PS7 macro

Customizing for your Install
----------------------------
build/init.mk should point to Xilinx Vivado, Xilinx SDK, and Verilator.
The default setup assumes you installed the 2014.2 version of the Xilinx
tools under /work/xilinx/... and built verilator under /work/verilator/...

Building Verilator
------------------
You can replace /work with some other convenient directory if you like
(but be sure to update build/init.mk):
1. cd /work
2. git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator
3. cd verilator
4. autoconf
5. ./configure
6. make -j32
7. you do not need to make install
